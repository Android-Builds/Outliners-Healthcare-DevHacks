### Project Overview
In our project the team tried to ease the hardships and risks for the people who are willing to help the others in this pandemic situation. We achieved it by providing all the possible information needed in a interactive and simple graphical interface application. It gives the user ability to report about any unattended crowds that need help, all the regional NGO and government relief camps, and  a map with locations of places were crowds are being helped currently and the details of the comminity or organization helpting them.
