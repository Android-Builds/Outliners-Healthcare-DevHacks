## OUTLINERS - HealthCare

### Project Overview
In our project the team tried to ease the hardships and risks for the people who are willing to help the others in this pandemic situation by designing a system which any user can use to report the location of any person in need of food and shelter.

### Solution Description
We achieved it by providing all the possible information needed in a interactive and simple graphical interface application. It gives the user ability to report about any unattended crowds or individuals that need help, all the regional and national NGOs and government relief camps, and on the admin side of things, a map with locations of places where the locations of people in need would be listed. We plan to generate a heatmap using the data which would show how much in need the people are so the authorities can plan out their sending of helps instead of randomly sending helps to any people.
